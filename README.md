# Predictive Analysis of Online Shoppers Intention

This project uses Python for predictive modeling and analysis of online shopper behavior. It explores the likelihood of a user generating revenue based on their session metrics, using data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ and the following libraries installed:

- numpy

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing

Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file and open it in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## Running the Tests

### Breakdown of Tests

The notebook evaluates models using:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC

## Deployment

For deploying this model:

- Serialize using `joblib` or `pickle`
- Build an API using Flask or FastAPI
